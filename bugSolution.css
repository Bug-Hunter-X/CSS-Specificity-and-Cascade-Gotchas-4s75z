To address these CSS specificity and cascade issues, it's recommended to:

1. **Use more specific selectors:** Instead of relying on general selectors (like `div p`), utilize more precise selectors that target the specific HTML elements you want to style.  For example, if you only want to style paragraphs within a div with a specific class, then use the ID selector or other more specific selectors.
2. **Organize your CSS:** Ensure that your CSS is well-organized and that the most specific styles are defined last. This helps to ensure that the intended styles are applied correctly.
3. **Use the `!important` flag sparingly:** While `!important` can override specificity, it's generally best avoided as it can make your CSS harder to maintain and debug. It should be the last resort in resolving overriding style issues.

Here is the updated CSS in `bugSolution.css`:

```css
div #myParagraph { color: blue; }
.special p { color: red; }

/*Now applying more specific selectors and using ids to resolve any issues*/
```

By making the selectors more specific, the expected styles are applied correctly.  Note that this improved approach focuses on cleaner, more maintainable CSS, reducing reliance on CSS overrides.
