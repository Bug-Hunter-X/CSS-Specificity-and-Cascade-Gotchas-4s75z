# CSS Specificity and Cascade Issues

This repository demonstrates a common problem in CSS: unexpected behavior resulting from specificity and cascade rules.

The `bug.css` file contains CSS that illustrates the issue.  `bugSolution.css` offers a solution to rectify the unexpected behavior.  The solution focuses on improving CSS structure and using more specific selectors to avoid conflicts.  The problem stems from the intricacies of how CSS resolves style conflicts, particularly when inheritance or multiple selectors are involved.
